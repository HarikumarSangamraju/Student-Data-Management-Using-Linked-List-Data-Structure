## ðŸ§­ Overview

This project implements a **Student Record Management System** entirely in C, without any external libraries or database engine. Records â€” roll number, name, and marks â€” are stored in a **singly linked list** in memory during runtime, and can be saved to / loaded from a flat file (`student.data`) so data survives across program runs.

The codebase is split into small, single-responsibility source files (one function/feature per file), making it easy to navigate, extend, or plug into a build system.

- âž• **Add** a new student record
- ðŸ“‹ **Show** all records in tabular form

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Makefile              # Build configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ student.h             # Struct definition + function prototypes
â”œâ”€â”€ main.c                # Entry point, menu loop, exit_list(), count()
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_load.c           # load_list()     â€” loads student.data on startup
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_add.c            # add_new()       â€” inserts a new record
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_show.c           # show_list()     â€” displays all records
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_del.c            # delete_a_node() â€” deletes one record
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_mod.c            # modify()        â€” edits an existing record
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_sort.c           # sort_list()     â€” sorts by name/marks
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_reverse.c        # reverse_list()  â€” reverses the list
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_deleteall.c      # delete_all()    â€” clears the list
â”œâ”€â”€ stud_save.c           # save()          â€” writes list to disk
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore
```

Every `.c` file includes `student.h`, which centralizes the shared `sll` (singly linked list) struct and all function prototypes â€” this is the single source of truth for the module's public interface.

---

## ðŸ§¬ Data Model

Each student record is represented as a node:

```c
typedef struct stu {
    int   roll;         // Unique roll number
    char  name[20];      // Student name (max 19 chars + null terminator)
    float marks;         // Marks / score
    struct stu *nxt;      // Pointer to the next node
} sll;
```

The list is referenced through a single head pointer (`sll *hptr`), initialized to `NULL` and passed by reference (`sll **`) to any function that may change what the head points to (add, delete, delete-all, reverse).

---

## ðŸ— Design Decisions

This section documents the *intentional* behavior baked into the system â€” useful context for anyone reading or extending the code.

### 1. Automatic, gap-filling roll numbers
Roll numbers are **not** manually entered â€” they're auto-assigned by `add_new()`:
- If the list is empty, the new record becomes roll `1`.
- If the first record isn't roll `1` (e.g., it was deleted), the new record is inserted at the head as roll `1`.
- Otherwise, the list is walked to find the **first gap** in the roll sequence (e.g., `1, 2, 4` â†’ gap at `3`) and the new record is inserted there.
- If no gap exists, the record is appended with `roll = last roll + 1`.

This keeps roll numbers dense and reusable instead of ever-increasing, at the cost of an O(n) scan on every insert.

### 2. In-place sorting, not pointer re-linking
`sort_list()` uses a **bubble sort** that swaps node *contents* (`roll`, `name`, `marks`) rather than re-linking `nxt` pointers. This is simpler to reason about but means node *identity* (memory address) does not track a particular student after a sort.

### 3. Array-assisted list reversal
`reverse_list()` temporarily stores all node pointers in a dynamically allocated array (`sll **a`), then re-links `nxt` pointers in reverse order. This trades O(n) extra memory for a straightforward, easy-to-verify reversal algorithm.

### 4. Explicit save vs. auto-load asymmetry
- **Saving is manual** â€” the user must press `v/V` (or choose "save & exit") to persist data.
- **Loading is automatic** â€” `load_list()` runs once at program startup and silently does nothing if `student.data` doesn't exist yet (first run).

This mirrors a typical "open file â†’ edit â†’ explicit save" workflow rather than auto-saving every change.

### 5. Menu is case-insensitive
Every menu option accepts both upper and lower case (`A`/`a`, `D`/`d`, etc.) by normalizing input with a simple `+= 32` ASCII shift.

### 6. Search-before-modify pattern
`modify()` never edits blindly â€” for name/marks-based searches, it first **lists all matching records**, then asks the user to specify the exact roll number to edit. This avoids accidentally modifying the wrong record when names or marks aren't unique.

### 7. Modular, one-feature-per-file layout
Rather than one large `main.c`, each menu action lives in its own translation unit. This keeps diffs small, makes the Makefile's dependency rule (`%.o: %.c student.h`) trivial, and mirrors how the project would scale if features were added or removed.

## âš™ï¸ Build Instructions

**Requirements:** `gcc` and `make` (Linux/macOS/WSL recommended).

```bash
# Clone or download the project, then:
make
```

This compiles all source files and links them into an executable named `student_record`.

To remove build artifacts and the runtime data file:

```bash
make clean
```

---

## â–¶ï¸ Usage

```bash
./student_record
```

You'll be greeted with a menu. Enter the corresponding letter (case-insensitive) and follow the prompts.

```

## ðŸ“‹ Menu Reference

| Key     | Action                                                        |

| `d`/`D` | Delete a record by roll number or name                        |
| `s`/`S` | Show all records in a table                                   |
| `m`/`M` | Modify a record (search by roll, name, or marks)              |
| `v`/`V` | Save the current list to `student.data`                       |
| `e`/`E` | Exit â€” choose "Save & Exit" or "Exit without saving"          |
| `t`/`T` | Sort the list by name or by marks                             |
| `b`/`B` | Delete all records                                            |
| `r`/`R` | Reverse the order of the list                                 |

## ðŸ’¾ Persistence Format

Records are stored as **plain text**, one record per line, in `student.data`:

```
<roll> <name> <marks>
```

**Example:**

```
1 Asha 88.500000
2 Ravi 76.250000
4 Meera 91.000000
```

This human-readable format makes it easy to inspect, back up, or edit the data outside the application if needed.

---

## ðŸš€ Possible Improvements

- Switch to `fgets` + parsing for names containing spaces.
- Add input validation (marks range, non-empty names).
- Replace bubble sort with a more efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets.
- Add unit tests for core list operations.
- Support CSV export for easier integration with spreadsheets.
